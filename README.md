Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
It is a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. It encompasses a variety of methods, practices, and tools used in the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems to ensure they are reliable, efficient, and meet user requirements

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 
Software Engineering is a structured approach to designing, developing, and maintaining software systems using engineering principles. It differs from traditional programming in that it focuses on the entire software development lifecycle, including planning, design, testing, and maintenance, with an emphasis on quality, scalability, and teamwork. Traditional programming, on the other hand, primarily focuses on writing code to solve specific problems without necessarily considering the broader context or long-term maintenance.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process used by software developers to design, develop, test, and deploy high-quality software. It provides a structured approach to software development, ensuring that the final product meets user requirements and is delivered on time and within budget. 

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
SDLC phases:

Planning: Establishing project goals, defining requirements, and creating a project plan. This phase involves feasibility studies and resource allocation.

Requirements Analysis: Gathering and analyzing the needs of the users to ensure the software meets their expectations. This phase results in detailed functional and non-functional requirements.

Design: Creating the architecture of the software. This includes both high-level design (overall system architecture) and detailed design (specific components and modules).

Implementation (Coding): Writing the actual code based on the design specifications. This phase involves translating design documents into executable software.

Testing: Verifying that the software functions correctly and meets the specified requirements. This phase includes various types of testing such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

Deployment: Releasing the software to users. This phase may involve installation, configuration, and providing user training and documentation.

Maintenance: Ongoing support and enhancement of the software after it has been deployed. This includes fixing bugs, adding new features, and making improvements.

Choosing the Right Model
Waterfall is more suitable for projects with clear, stable requirements and where the technology is well understood. It works well in regulatory environments where extensive documentation is required.

Agile is better suited for projects where requirements are expected to evolve and where early and continuous delivery of working software is beneficial. It is ideal for projects that require close collaboration with customers and stakeholders.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Key Differences
Process Flow:
Waterfall: Linear, sequential phases.
Agile: Iterative, incremental sprints.
Flexibility:

Requirements Engineering (RE) is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the requirements for a software system to ensure it meets the needs and expectations of stakeholders. It is a crucial part of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that guides the development, design, and testing phases.
Process of Requirements Engineering
Elicitation: Gathering requirements from stakeholders using techniques like interviews, surveys, observations, and workshops.
Analysis: Refining and prioritizing the gathered requirements, resolving conflicts, and ensuring feasibility.
Specification: Documenting the requirements in a detailed and structured format, such as a Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
Validation: Ensuring the requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are achievable, often through reviews and prototyping.
Management: Continuously managing and maintaining the requirements throughout the project lifecycle to handle changes and ensure consistency.
Importance in the SDLC
